## What it does?

Reads a json file i.e. https://github.com/datameet/railways/blob/master/trains.json
and outputs a MongoDb insertable json

## NOTE

Addition of square brackets '[]' was done manually and removed last key value pair:
`"type": "FeatureCollection"` from it

## OUTPUT
trains.json is raw json file without id\_
